title={Image denoising using a neural network based non-linear filter in wavelet domain},
author={Zhang, Shuangteng and Salari, Ezzatollah},
booktitle={Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 2005. Proceedings.(ICASSP'05). IEEE International Conference on},
volume={2},
pages={ii--989},
year={2005},
organization={IEEE},
abstract={A neural network based method performed in the wavelet transform domain is developed for image denoising.  Unlike the wavelet thresholding methods which usually require three or more levels of wavelet decomposition and need the accurate estimate of the involved noise to obtain good denoising results, this method needs only one level of wavelet decomposition and can adapt itself to the various noise environments by learning.}
