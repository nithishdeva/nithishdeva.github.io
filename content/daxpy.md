[AXPY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms#Functionality) is one of the 38 subroutines described in the [original specification](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19780018835) for [BLAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms) describing addition of constant times a vector plus a vector. 

$$\vec{y} \gets a\vec{x} + \vec{y}$$

Its double varient is called DAXPY.

All other linear algebra algorithms can be implemented as using daxpy routines.
