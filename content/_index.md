Hi there,

*daxpy* is [my](/about) online notebook. [Posts](/posts) are long form notes while [notes](/notes) are short, quick notes; usually about a single focused topic. 


I also like to read about random things. In process, I've curated a slowly growing list of amazing articles I've come across. See the [links](/links) section for those.
