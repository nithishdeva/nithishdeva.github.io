Hi there.  
`daxpy` is [my](/about) online notebook. You will mostly find things I used to scribble on to a notebook, maybe a bit more organised and polished. Only a bit though. 

[Posts](/posts) are long form notes while [notes](/notes) are, well, small notes; one pagers. 


I also like to read about random things. There are no themes of what I generally read about. I've curated a slowly growing collection of amazing articles I've come across in the  [links](/links) section.
