# Productivity Principles


I am writing this with an unsure mind. These are not correct, but these are mine. I am in a constant state of trying to follow these principles. I also want to begin every sentence with  "Your milage may vary, but".

## Barely working systems
**Do things inefficiently**. [This article](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2023/04/20/hobbies.html) mentions that all hobbies are 4 hobbies. The gist is, we get trapped in the tools of the activity then the activity itself. I keep beautifying this website than writing on it. The solution is to do things inefficiently. You know when some thign barely works, it still is working. Any time you spend on optimising the process is time away from actually doing. 

## Or Nothing
I think I *read* it first in a [podcast](https://tim.blog/2020/12/09/jerry-seinfeld-transcript/) of Jerry Sienfield. Basically, you decide on a block of time. 30 mins, 1 hour etc, set a timer for that duration. now before the timer goes off, you can do THE thing, but nothing else. Dont feel like doing it, just sit there and do nothing. Dont look at the phone, don't read a book. THE THING or nothing.



## Monthly plans

No schedule or stratergy is optimal when it comes to personal productivity. Things change, life gets in the way. But having a plan that needs to be changed at a moments notice is also counter productive to maintain discipline. So "monthly" frequency seems like a good tradeoff. I've tried weekly andits too soon. Quaterly seems too long to suffer through a bad plan. 

> Reevaluate and update your schedule/plan every month. But stick to it in that period even if you find the flaws.  

Another tangential tip here is to plan for 4 weeks. i.e 1-28 of any month, stick to the plan and take the remaining days of the month as vacation or free style.

## Sleep
I keep joking that everything we do, everything, is to sleep and eat. If either of those are not meet, then everything else is pointless. Alarms to wake up is flying in the face of this principle of mine. So

> Don't wake up to an alarm. Maybe keep an alarm to go to sleep.

Again, the principle has to be tweeked. It would be stupid to sleep through If I have a flight to catch. So, sleep as much as you want **most of the time**.

How to change the time you sleep?
  - See the next tip on how to fool yourself w.r.to time.
  - Quick cold shower right before your bed time. Dont take more than 2 min to execute. Otherwise the lazy mind will kick in. Quick shower.
  - Cooler temperature seems to go hand in hand with sleep for me. YMMV

## Analog Watch
Wanna sleep at 10 while you regularly sleep at 12, get yourslef an analog watch and turn in 2 hours ahead. When the watch shows 12, go to sleep. Reduce the time differential at your own pace. 

Did the tip looks stupid? How will I believe the time in watch when i know its ahead? I have no idea. But it works. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

You can use this for very many things. Have a time bound exam for 3 hours, turn the time to 9 am when you practise and when its 12 in watch, your 3 hours are up. 

Digital watch shows you the time. Analog watches showyou how much time is left. 

## Calendar. Not to-do lists

This is a bit extreme. Read more [here](https://deviparikh.medium.com/calendar-in-stead-of-to-do-lists-9ada86a512dd). I equate this technique to learning vim. Very steep learning curve; very high barrier to entry, but extremly useful and becomes a second nature once you get used to it. Viewing time as space allows you to see the bigger picture.



## Write
paper, docs, white board anything. Do not get trapped into the hell of organising things. dont even bother to keep things in one place. Writing is hard. Dont add any barrier. Even searching for a pen would put me off of writing. 

Writing has this magical ability to linearise your thoughts. Thing become clearer and concise when you see your own words explaining it to you. 
 
## Be Forgiving
This is the most effective productivity principle I have. There is no point in being furstrated when your plan doesnt work out. The point it to do things. Not do things according to plan. Plan and schedule is to aid in doing things. 


Tips.
- Doing a thing everyday is more sustainable than doing it every other day or once a week etc.
