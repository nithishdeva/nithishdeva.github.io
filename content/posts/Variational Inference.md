# Variational Inference

We have some data from a population and we suspect that the it is generated by some underlying process. Estimating the process which generates the data allows us to understand its  fundamental properties. 

Concretely, $p(x)$ is the distribution of the data and $z$ are its latent variables, the process which generates the data is $p(x|z)$. 
Estimating the generation process is computing the true posterior $p(z|x)$. This is the (posterior) inference problem. 

From Bayes rule, we have 
$$p(z|x) = \frac{p(x,z)}{p(x)}$$
with $p(x) = \int_z p(x,z)$. But this is often intractable as the quantities on RHS are non-trivial to estimate. 

Variational inference is the technique which helps in converting this estimation problem into an optimization problem by approximating the posterior $p(z|x)$ with a family of simpler distributions $q_v(z)$. The best approximation is found by minimizing the [divergence] between $q$ and $p$. 

$$ \min_v D_{KL}[q_v(z), p(z|x)] $$

$q_v$ is a family of distribution and a specific member is selected by $v$. In this context, $v$'s are called _variational parameters_.

There are many different [divergence] measures. But we are going to stick with [KL divergence] as it has a straight forward definition. Note that it is asymmetric.

$$D_{KL}(p,q) = \int_{\Omega} p \log\frac{p}{q}$$

Although this sounds promising and simple in theory, in practise we run into some difficulties. Optimising [KL divergence] is practically difficult. The gradient is readily available for simpler distributions and in practise $p$ can be very complex. This will force us to use very simple $q$ and have a bad approximations.

Let see if we can optimise KL divergence indirectly.

Consider this. $\log p(x)$ is called *evidence* or *log-evidence* of $x$ and is considered a constant. Since $\int_z q_v(z)=1$ we can write

$$\log p(x) = \log p(x) \int_z q_v(z)$$

Since $p(x)$ is invariant to the w.r.to $z$, we have,

$$\log p(x)  = \int_z q_v(z) \log p(x)$$

A bit of clever substitutions and wrangling later,

$$ \log p(x) =\int_z q_v(z) \log \frac{p(x,z)}{q_v(z)} - \int_z q_v(z) \log \frac{p(z|x)}{q_v(z)}$$

Thus we have the following system.

$$\log p(x)    = L(q,p) - D_{KL}(q,p)$$

$\log p(x)$ is constant and KL divergence is always $\geq 0$. The $L(q,p)$ is thus lower bound on the approximation between $p$ and $q$. It is hence called *[Evidence Lower Bound]* or ELBO. 

Since a constant is equal to difference between 2 variables, maximising ELBO decreases the KL divergence making approximation of $q$ to $p$ better. Now we have an alternate way to find the best approximation.


## Evidence Lower Bound
One easy way to understand effect of optimising evidence lower bound is to think of it as a combination of 2 entropies. 
$$L(q,p) = H(q) - H(q,p)$$
While maximizing $L$, the entropy term is pushing $q$ to spread everywhere while the negative cross entropy term is pushing $q$ to concentrate on regions where  $p$ has high density.
However, for using as a training objective, we need its gradient. 


## Black Box Variational Inference

ELBO has the following equivalent form.

$$L(q,p) = \mathbb{E}\_{q_v(z)} \left [ \log p(x,z) - \log q_v(z) \right ]$$


[Ranganath et al. (2014)] gives the following form of gradient.
$$\nabla_v L(v) = \mathbb{E}\_{q_v(z)} \left [ \nabla_v \log q_v(z)\\, (\log p(x,z) - \log q_v(z) )\right ]$$

Gradient of the log of probability distribution is called score function and this gradient is known as **score gradient**. When the gradient is in form of an expectation of a random variable, we take monte-carlo samples and to get [approximate gradient][stochastic approximation].

Also note that the gradient assumes no knowledge of the model except that we can evaluate the quantities in the equation. More of less, a *Black Box Variational Inference*.

Unfortunately, the approximation of the gradient has high variance. Fortunately, [Ranganath et al. (2014)] also describes a few variance reduction techniques.

## Reprameterisation gradient

Score gradient allows us to use complex distributions to approximate posterior distribution. But it is difficult to sample from complex distributions. [Reparametrisation trick][Kingma et al. (2013)] allows us to create complex distributions from simple ones.

Say we are able to write $z = t(\epsilon, v)$ with
 $\epsilon \sim s(\epsilon)$, a simple distribution which we can  sample from.
What we have done is to bound all "randomness" to $s(\epsilon)$ and made $q_v(z)$ "non-random".

With this, we have a simpler gradient for elbo.

$$\nabla_v L(v) = \mathbb{E}\_{s(\epsilon)}\big[  \nabla_z \left[ \log p(x,z) - \log q_v(z) \right] \nabla_v t(\epsilon, v) \big]$$


To compute approximate gradient, take samples $\epsilon \sim s(\epsilon)$, compute $z = t(\epsilon, v)$ and then evaluate the reparameterization gradient. 
$\log p(x,z) - \log q_v(z)$ is the model and $\nabla_z(\cdots)$ can be evaluated using auto-differentiation. See [Ruiz et al. (2016)] for more discussion on reprameterisation gradient.


## Amortised Variational Inference

Variational Inference is still not scalable. We still have to fit the variational parameter for each observations essentially minimising KL divergence between each $q_v(z)$ and $p(z|x_i)$. This is not scalable and will lead to over fitting.

We can get around this by constrianing the variational parameters to be a function of the observations; a learnable function. 

$$v = g_\phi(x)$$

In [Amortised Inference][Anh Le (2017)], the variational parameters are output of a network which takes the samples from true distribution as input. The parameters of the network can be learned by optimising reparameterisation gradient.

$$\nabla_\phi L(\phi) = \mathbb{E}\_{s(\epsilon)}\big[  \nabla_z \left[ \log p(x,z) - \log q_v(z) \right] \nabla_\phi t(\epsilon, g_\phi(x)) \big]$$

## Variational Auto Encoders

[Variational auto encoders][kingma et al. (2013)] are a generative model which learns to generate data from its true distribution. It has an architecture simlar to a [denoising auto encoder][Vincent et al. (2010)] and uses variational inference to learn the distribution. 


Variational auto encoders  make a constraint that the posterior is approximated by an gaussian distribution with diagonal covariances. As a result, the latent representation will have linearly independent dimensions. 

The encoder is a differentiable network which is used to approximate posterior distribution $p(z|x)$. The network is trained to predict the parameters of the approximating distribution from a data point. 

$$\mu, \sigma = g_{\phi}(x)$$

then, the posterior is approximated by the distribution 
$$ q_{\mu, \sigma}(z)= \mathcal{N}(z; \mu, diag(\sigma^2))$$

 The latent vector is obtained by sampling from $q_{\mu, \sigma}(z)$.

The decoder is also a differentiable network which is trained to predict a sample from the latent vector.
$$\hat{x} = f_{\theta}(z)$$

Different samples generate different predictions thus generating samples from $p(x|z)$. Some designs explicitly adds "intelligent noise" to aid in directed distribution. $\hat{x} = f_{\theta}(z+\epsilon)$


The forward inference of variational auto encoder defined in the [Kingma et al. (2013)] has the following form. 

$$(\mu, \log \sigma) = g_\phi(x) $$
$$q_{\mu,\sigma}(z|x) = \mathcal{N} (z; \mu, diag(\sigma^2))$$
$$z \sim q_{\mu,\sigma}(z|x)$$
$$ \hat{x} = f_{\theta}(z)$$


Both the encoder and decoder are neural networks and $\phi$ and $\theta$ are their parameters. Both the networks are trained end to end to miniminse the following loss. 
$$L
 = C\\|x - f(z) \\|^2 + D_{KL}(\mathcal{N}(\mu, diag(\sigma^2), \mathcal{N}(0,I))$$
